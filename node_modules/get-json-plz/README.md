# Get JSON Please [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanong/get-json-plz.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanong/get-json-plz)

Simple utility to request JSON from servers.
If the status code isn't a 200, it won't return anything.

## API

```js
var get = require('get-json-plz')
```

### get(url, [callback])

```js
get('http://nodejs.org/api/http.json', function (err, data) {

})
```

You can also use it as a yieldable:

```js
co(function* () {
  var data = yield get('http://nodejs.org/api/http.json')
})
```
